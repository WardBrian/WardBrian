### Hi there 👋

I’m a software engineer and (mostly retired) theatrical technician and designer.
In the summer of 2021 I joined the Center for Computational Mathematics at the
[Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/) where I primarily
work as a member of the [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) development team focusing on
[stanc3](https://github.com/stan-dev/stanc3), our OCaml-based compiler for Stan.

My interests lie in programming languages and other rules-based systems. I am not currently
working on anything theatrical, but when I do I focus on lighting design and event
control systems.
